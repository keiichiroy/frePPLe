Demands          demand            The demand(s) (and quantity) pegged to the manufacturing order. This is a generated field.
Owner            number            In the case of a suboperation, the identifier of the operation calling this suboperation.
criticality      number            | The criticality is a read-only field, calculated by the planning engine. 
                                   | It represents an indication of the slack time in the usage of the manufacturing order.
                                   | A criticality of 0 indicates that the manufacturing order is on the critical path of one or more demands.
                                   | Higher criticality values indicate a delay of the manufacturing order will not immediately impact the shipment of any demand.                                   
                                   | A criticality of 999 indicates a manufacturing order that isnâ€™t used at all to meet any demand.
                                   | Note that the criticality is independent of whether the customer demand will be shipped on time or not.

                                   | It compares the end data of the manufacturing order with the latest possible end date to ship all demands it feeds on time.
